Scifi Objects Pack Notes
Last Updated 2013-07-12 by Kristopher Peterson (kristopher.patrick.peterson@gmail.com)

Hey, first off thanks for purchasing and using this pack!  

This pack was authored in Unity 3.5 so if you are using Unity4x you will get a prompt when importing the textures to 'fix' by converting to normal map, and you'll want to choose to ignore that.  The 'Import Type' should be left at 'Default'.

There are a few import warnings that will show up the first time you import these assets, but they will not cause any issues.

Please direct any questions, comments, issues, or requests to the Unity thread at: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/186858-Scifi-Objects-Pack?p=1276913
