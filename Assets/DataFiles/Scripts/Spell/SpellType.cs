//See our trailer (pinned message) for an example of the freeze spell

//Swap places with the racer Infront of you.So it would teleport you in their position and teleports them to your position.So the person that uses it teleports forwards and the other player teleports backwards.


//Invisibility spell:
//Players car goes translucent(can still see it a bit) for 8 seconds.They can go through other players cars and can't be targeted by other players spells during this 8 seconds. So the car might look something like this above ^^
